       "' \\n \\nBudget 202 5-2026 \\n \\nSpeech of  \\nNirmala Sitharaman  \\nMinister of Finance  \\nFebruary 1 , 202 5 \\nHon’ble Speaker,  \\n I present the Budget for 2025 -26. \\nIntroduction  \\n1. This Budget continues our Government ’s efforts to:  \\na) accelerate growth,  \\nb) secure inclusive development,  \\nc) invigorate private sector investments,  \\nd) uplift household sentiments, and \\ne) enhance spending power of India’s rising middle class.  \\n2. Together, we embark on a journey to unlock our nation’s treme ndous \\npotential for greater prosperity and global positioning under the leadership of \\nHon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.  \\n3. As we complete the first quarter of the 21st century, continuing \\ngeopolitical headwinds suggest lower  global economic growth ov er the \\nmedium term. However, our aspiration for a Viksit Bharat inspires us, and the \\ntransformative work we have done during our Government ’s first two terms \\nguides us, to march forward resolutely.  \\nBudget Theme  \\n4. Our economy is the fastest -growing among all  major global \\neconomies. Our development track record of the past 10 years and structural \\nreforms have drawn global attention. Confidence in India’s capability and  2  \\n \\npotential has only grown in this period. We see the next five years as a unique \\nopportunity to realize ‘Sabka Vikas’, stimulating balanced growth of all \\nregions.  \\n5. The great Telugu poet and playwright Gurajada Appa Rao had said, \\n‘Desamante Matti Kaadoi, Desamante Manushuloi ’; meaning, ‘A country is \\nnot just its soil, a country is its people.’ In li ne with this, for us, Viksit Bharat, \\nencompasses:  \\na) zero -poverty;  \\nb) hundred per cent good quality school education;   \\nc) access to high -quality, affordable, and comprehensive healthcare;  \\nd) hundred per cent skilled labour with meaningful employment;  \\ne) seventy per cent  women in economic activities; and  \\nf) farmers making our country the ‘food basket of the world’.  \\n6. In this Budget, the proposed development measures span ten broad \\nareas focusing on Garib, Youth, Annadata and Nari.  \\n1) Spurring Agricultural Growth and Productivity ; \\n2) Building Rural Prosperity and Resilience;  \\n3) Taking Everyone Together on an Inclusive Growth path;  \\n4) Boosting Manufacturing and Furthering Make in India;  \\n5) Supporting MSMEs;  \\n6) Enabling Employment -led Development;  \\n7) Investing in people, economy and innovation;  \\n8) Secu ring Energy Supplies;  \\n9) Promoting Exports; and  \\n10) Nurturing Innovation . \\n7. For this journey of development,  \\na) Our four powerful engines are: Agriculture, MSME, Investment, and \\nExports  \\nb) The fuel: our Reforms  \\nc) Our guiding spirit: Inclusivity   3  \\n \\nd) And the destination: Viksit Bharat  \\n8. This Budget aims to initiate transformative reforms across six domains. \\nDuring the next five years, these will augment our growth potential and global \\ncompetitiveness. The domains are:  \\n1) Taxation;  \\n2) Power Sector;  \\n3) Urban Development;  \\n4) Mining;  \\n5) Finan cial Sector; and  \\n6) Regulatory Reforms.  \\nAgriculture as the 1st Engine  \\n9. Now I move to specific proposals, beginning with ‘Agriculture as the 1st \\nEngine’.  \\nPrime Minister Dhan -Dhaanya Krishi Yojana - Developing Agri Districts \\nProgramme  \\n10. Motivated by the success of the Aspirational Districts Programme, our \\nGovernment  will undertake a ‘Prime Minister Dhan -Dhaanya Krishi Yojana ’ in \\npartnership with states. Through the convergence of existing schemes and \\nspecialized measures, the programme wi ll cover 100 districts with low \\nproductivity, moderate crop intensity and below -average credit parameters. It \\naims to (1) enhance agricultural productivity, (2) adopt crop diversification \\nand sustainable agriculture practices, (3) augment post -harvest stor age at the \\npanchayat and block level, (4) improve irrigation facilities, and (5) facilitate \\navailability of long -term and short -term credit. This programme is likely to \\nhelp 1.7 crore farmers.  \\nBuilding Rural Prosperity and Resilience  \\n11. A comprehensive multi -sectoral ‘Rural Prosperity and Resilience’ \\nprogramme will be launched in partnership with states. This will address \\nunder -employment in agriculture through skilling, investment, technology, \\nand invigorating the rural economy. The goal is to generate ample \\nopportunities in rural areas so that migration is an option, but not a necessity.  \\n12. The programme will focus on rural women, young farmers, rural  4  \\n \\nyouth, marginal and small farmers, and landless families. Details are in \\nAnnexure A.  \\n13. Global and domestic best practices will be incorporated and \\nappropriate technical and financial assistance will be sought from multilateral \\ndevelopment banks. In Phase -1, 100 developing agri -districts will be covered.   \\nAatmanirbharta in Pulses    \\n14. Our Government  is implementing th e National Mission for Edible \\nOilseed for achieving atmanirbhrata in edible oils. Our farmers have the \\ncapability to grow enough for our needs and more.  \\n15. Ten years ago, we made concerted efforts and succeeded in achieving \\nnear self -sufficiency in pulses. F armers responded to the need by increasing \\nthe cultivated area by 50 per cent and Government  arranged for procurement \\nand remunerative prices. Since then, with rising incomes and better \\naffordability, our consumption of pulses has increased significantly.  \\n16. Our Government  will now launch a 6 -year “Mission for \\nAatmanirbharta in Pulses” with a special focus on Tur, Urad and Masoor.  \\nDetails are in Annexure B. Central agencies (NAFED and NCCF) will be ready to \\nprocure these 3 pulses, as much as offered during t he next 4 years from \\nfarmers who register with these agencies and enter into agreements.   \\nComprehensive Programme for Vegetables & Fruits  \\n17. It is encouraging that our people are increasingly becoming aware of \\ntheir nutritional needs. It is a sign of a socie ty becoming healthier. With rising \\nincome levels, the consumption of vegetables, fruits and shree -anna is \\nincreasing significantly. A comprehensive programme to promote production, \\nefficient supplies, processing, and remunerative prices for farmers will be  \\nlaunched in partnership with states. Appropriate institutional mechanisms for \\nimplementation and participation of farmer producer organizations and \\ncooperatives will be set up.   \\nMakhana Board in Bihar  \\n18. For this, there is a special opportunity for the people of Bihar. A \\nMakhana Board will be established in the state to improve production, \\nprocessing, value addition, and marketing of makhana. The people engaged in \\nthese activities will be organized into FP Os. The Board will provide  5  \\n \\nhandholding and training support to makhana farmers and will also work to \\nensure they receive the benefits of all relevant Government  schemes.    \\nNational Mission on High Yielding Seeds  \\n19. A National Mission on High Yielding Seeds w ill be launched, aimed at \\n(1) strengthening the research ecosystem, (2) targeted development and \\npropagation of seeds with high yield, pest resistance and climate resilience, \\nand (3) commercial availability of more than 100 seed varieties released since \\nJuly 2024.  \\nFisheries  \\n20. India ranks second -largest globally in fish production and aquaculture. \\nSeafood exports are valued at ` 60 thousand crore. To unlock the untapped \\npotential of the marine sector, our Government  will bring in an enabling \\nframework for sus tainable harnessing of fisheries from Indian Exclusive \\nEconomic Zone and High Seas, with a special focus on the Andaman & Nicobar \\nand Lakshadweep Islands.  \\nMission for Cotton Productivity  \\n21. For the benefit of lakhs of cotton growing farmers, I am pleased to \\nannounce a ‘Mission for Cotton Productivity’. This 5 -year mission will facilitate \\nsignificant improvements in productivity and sustainability of cotton farming, \\nand promote extra -long staple cotton varieties. The best of science & \\ntechnology support will b e provided to farmers. Aligned with our integrated \\n5F vision for the textile sector, this will help in increasing incomes of the \\nfarmers, and ensure a steady supply of quality cotton for rejuvenating India’s \\ntraditional textile sector.  \\nEnhanced Credit thr ough KCC  \\n22. Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) facilitate short term loans for 7.7 crore \\nfarmers, fishermen, and dairy farmers. The loan limit under the Modified \\nInterest Subvention Scheme will be enhanced from ` 3 lakh to 5 lakh for loans \\ntaken through the KCC.   \\nUrea  Plant in Assam  \\n23. For Atmanirbharta in urea production, our Government  had reopened \\nthree dormant urea plants in the Eastern region. To further augment urea \\nsupply, a plant with annual capacity of 12.7 lakh metric tons will be set up at \\nNamrup, Assam.  \\nIndia Post as a Catalyst for the Rural Economy  \\n24. India Post with 1.5 lakh rural post offices, complemented by the India  6  \\n \\nPost Payment Bank and a vast network of 2.4 lakh Dak Sevaks, will be \\nrepositioned to act as a catalyst for the rural economy. Details are at \\nAnnexure C.  \\n25. India Post will also be transformed as a large public logistics \\norganization. This will meet the rising needs of Viswakarmas, new \\nentrepreneurs, women, self -help groups, MSMEs, and large business \\norganizations.  \\nSupport to NCDC  \\n26. Our Government  will provide support to NCDC for its lending \\noperations for the cooperative sector.  \\nMSMEs as the 2nd engine  \\n27. Now, I move to MSMEs as the 2nd engine, which encompasses \\nmanufacturing and services with a focus on MSMEs  numbering 5.7 crore . \\nRevision in classif ication criteria for MSMEs  \\n28. Currently, over 1 crore registered MSMEs, employing 7.5 crore \\npeople, and generating 36 per cent of our manufacturing, have come \\ntogether to position India as a global manufacturing hub. With their quality \\nproducts, these MSMEs a re responsible for 45 per cent of our exports. To \\nhelp them achieve higher efficiencies of scale, technological upgradation \\nand better access to capital, the investment and turnover limits for \\nclassification of all MSMEs will be enhanced to 2.5 and 2 times  respectively. \\nThis will give them the confidence to grow and generate employment for \\nour youth. The details are in Annexure D.  \\nSignificant enhancement of credit availability with guarantee cover  \\n29. To improve access to credit, the credit guarantee cover will  be \\nenhanced : \\na) For Micro and Small Enterprises, from ` 5 crore to 10 crore, \\nleading to additional credit of ` 1.5 lakh crore in the next 5 years;  \\nb) For Startups, from ` 10 crore to 20 crore , with the guarantee fee \\nbeing moderated to 1 per cent for loans in 27 focus sectors \\nimportant for Atmanirbhar Bharat; and  \\nc) For well -run exporter MSMEs, for term loans up to ` 20 crore.  \\nCredit Cards for Micro Enterprises   7  \\n \\n30. We will introduce customized Credit Cards with a ` 5 lakh limit for \\nmicro enterprises registered on Udyam portal. In the first year, 10 lakh such \\ncards will be issued.  \\nFund of Funds for Startups  \\n31. The Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs) for startups have received \\ncommitments of more than ` 91,00 0 crore.

The scheme is expected to \\nfacilitate employm ent for 22 lakh persons, generate turnover of ` 4 lakh crore \\nand exports of over ` 1.1 lakh crore.  \\nMeasures for the Toy Sector  \\n35. Building on the National Action Plan for Toys, we will implement a \\nscheme to make India a global hub for toys. The scheme will focus on \\ndevelopment of clusters, skills, and a manufacturing ecosystem  that will \\ncreate high -quality, unique, innovative, and sustainable toys that will \\nrepresent the \\'Made in India\\' brand.  \\nSupport for Food Processing   8  \\n \\n36. In line with our commitment towards ‘ Purvodaya’, we will establish a \\nNational Institute of Food Technology, Entrepreneurship and Management in \\nBihar. The institute will provide a strong fillip to food processing activities in \\nthe entire Eastern region. This will result in (1) enhanced income for the \\nfarmers through value addition to their produce, and (2) skilling, \\nentrepreneurship and employment opportunities for the youth.  \\nManufacturing Mission - Furthering “Make in India”  \\n37.

Hotels in those destinations \\nwill be included in the infrastructure HML.   \\n76. The following measures will be taken for facilitating employment -led \\ngrowth:  \\n1) Organizing intensive skill -development programmes for our youth  14  \\n \\nincluding in Institutes of Hospitality Management;  \\n2) Providing MUDRA loans for homestays;  \\n3) Improving ease of travel and connectivity to tourist destinations;  \\n4) Providing performance -linked incent ives to states for effective \\ndestination management including tourist amenities, cleanliness, \\nand marketing efforts; and  \\n5) Introducing streamlined e -visa facilities along with visa -fee \\nwaivers for certain tourist groups.  \\n77. Continuing with the emphasis on place s of spiritual and religious \\nsignificance in the July Budget, there will be a special focus on destinations \\nrelated to the life and times of Lord Buddha.  \\nMedical Tourism and Heal in India  \\n78. Medical Tourism and Heal in India will be promoted in partnership \\nwith the private sector along with capacity building and easier visa norms.  \\nC. Investing in Innovation  \\nResearch, Development and Innovation  \\n79. To implement private sector driven Research, Deve lopment and \\nInnovation initiative announced in the July Budget, I am now allocating  \\n` 20,000 crore.   \\nDeep Tech Fund of Funds  \\n80. A Deep Tech Fund of Funds will also be explored to catalyze the next \\ngeneration startups as a part of this initiative.  \\nPM Resea rch Fellowship  \\n81. In the next five years, under the PM Research Fellowship scheme, we \\nwill provide ten thousand fellowships for technological research in IITs and \\nIISc with enhanced financial support.  \\nGene Bank for Crops Germplasm  \\n82. The 2nd Gene Bank with 10 lakh germplasm lines will be set up for \\nfuture food and nutritional security. This will provide conservation support to \\nboth public and private sectors for genetic resources.   \\nNational Geospatial Mission   15  \\n \\n83. We will start a National Geospat ial Mission to develop foundational \\ngeospatial infrastructure and data. Using PM Gati Shakti, this Mission will \\nfacilitate modernization of land records, urban planning, and design of \\ninfrastructure projects.   \\nGyan Bharatam Mission  \\n84. A Gyan Bharatam Mission  for survey, documentation and conservation \\nof our manuscript heritage with academic institutions, museums, libraries and \\nprivate collectors will be undertaken to cover more than 1 crore manuscripts. \\nWe will set up a National Digital Repository of Indian k nowledge systems for \\nknowledge sharing.  \\n85. Now, I move to Exports as the 4th engine.   \\nExports as the 4th engine  \\nExport Promotion Mission  \\n86. We will set up an Export Promotion Mission, with sectoral and \\nministerial targets, driven jointly by the Ministries of Commerce, MSME, and \\nFinance. It will facilitate easy access to export credit, cross -border factoring \\nsupport, and support to MSMEs to tackle non -tariff measures in overseas \\nmarkets.  \\nBharatTradeNet  \\n87. A digital public infrastructure, ‘BharatTradeNet’ (BTN) for  international \\ntrade will be set -up as a unified platform for trade documentation and \\nfinancing solutions. This will complement the Unified Logistics Interface \\nPlatform. The BTN will be aligned with international practices.  \\nSupport for integration with Global Supply Chains  \\n88. Support will be provided to develop domestic manufacturing \\ncapacities for our economy’s integration with global supply chains. Sectors \\nwill be identified based on objective criteria.  \\n89. Facilitation groups with participation of senior of ficers and industry \\nrepresentatives will be formed for select products and supply chains.  \\n90.  Through this, there are huge opportunities related to Industry 4.0, \\nwhich needs high skills and talent. Our youth have both. Our Government  will \\nsupport the domestic  electronic equipment industry to leverage this \\nopportunity for the benefit of the youth.   16  \\n \\nNational Framework for GCC  \\n91. A national framework will be formulated as guidance to states for \\npromoting Global Capability Centres in emerging tier 2 cities. This will  suggest \\nmeasures for enhancing availability of talent and infrastructure, building -\\nbyelaw reforms, and mechanisms for collaboration with industry.  \\nWarehousing facility for air cargo  \\n92. Our Government will facilitate upgradation of infrastructure and \\nwarehou sing for air cargo including high value perishable horticulture \\nproduce. Cargo screening and customs protocols will be streamlined and \\nmade user -friendly.      \\nReforms as the Fuel  \\n93. Now I move to ‘Reforms as the Fuel’, and detail specific reforms.  \\nTax Refor ms \\n94. Over the past 10 years, our Government  has implemented several \\nreforms for convenience of tax payers, such as (1) faceless assessment, (2) tax \\npayers charter, (3) faster returns, (4) almost 99 per cent returns being on self -\\nassessment, and (5) Vivad  se Vishwas scheme. Continuing these efforts,  \\nI reaffirm the commitment of the tax department to “trust first, scrutinize \\nlater”. I also propose to introduce the new income -tax bill next week. I will \\ndetail the indirect tax reforms and changes in direct t axes in Part B.   \\nFinancial Sector Reforms and Development  \\nFDI in Insurance Sector  \\n95. The FDI limit for the insurance sector will be raised from 74 to 100 per \\ncent. This enhanced limit will be available for those companies which invest \\nthe entire premium in I ndia. The current guardrails and conditionalities \\nassociated with foreign investment will be reviewed and simplified.  \\nExpanding Services of India Post Payment Bank  \\n96. The services of India Post Payment Bank will be deepened and \\nexpanded in rural areas.  \\nCredit Enhancement Facility by NaBFID  \\n97. NaBFID will set up a ‘Partial Credit Enhancement Facility’ for corporate \\nbonds for infrastructure.  \\nGrameen Credit Score   17  \\n \\n98. Public Sector Banks will develop ‘Grameen Credit Score’ framework to \\nserve the credit needs of SHG  members and people in rural areas.  \\nPension Sector  \\n99. A forum for regulatory coordination and development of pension \\nproducts will be set up.  \\nKYC Simplification  \\n100. To implement the earlier announcement on simplifying the KYC \\nprocess, the revamped Central KYC R egistry will be rolled out in 2025. We will \\nalso implement a streamlined system for periodic updating.  \\nMerger of Companies  \\n101. Requirements and procedures for speedy approval of company \\nmergers will be rationalized. The scope for fast -track mergers will also be \\nwidened and the process made simpler.  \\nBilateral Investment Treaties  \\n102. As proposed in the Interim Budget, we signed Bilateral Investment \\nTreaties (BIT) with two countries in 2024. To encourage sustained foreign \\ninvestment and in the spirit of ‘first develo p India’, the current model BIT will \\nbe revamped and made more investor -friendly.  \\nRegulatory Reforms  \\n103. In the last ten years in several aspects, including financial and non -\\nfinancial, our Government  has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to \\n‘Ease of Doing B usiness’. We are determined to ensure that our regulations \\nmust keep up with technological innovations and global policy developments. \\nA light -touch regulatory framework based on principles and trust will unleash \\nproductivity and employment. Through this f ramework, we will update \\nregulations that were made under old laws. To develop this modern, flexible, \\npeople -friendly, and trust -based regulatory framework appropriate for the \\ntwenty -first century, I propose four specific measures:  \\nHigh Level Committee for  Regulatory Reforms  \\n104. A High -Level Committee for Regulatory Reforms will be set up for a  18  \\n \\nreview of all non -financial sector regulations, certifications, licenses, and \\npermissions. The committee will be expected make recommendations within \\na year. The objecti ve is to strengthen trust -based economic governance and \\ntake transformational measures to enhance ‘ease of doing business’, \\nespecially in matters of inspections and compliances.  States will be \\nencouraged to join in this endeavour.  \\nInvestment Friendliness  Index of States  \\n105. An Investment Friendliness Index of States will be launched in 2025 to \\nfurther the spirit of competitive cooperative federalism.  \\nFSDC Mechanism  \\n106. Under the Financial Stability and Development Council, a mechanism \\nwill be set up to evaluate  impact of the current financial regulations and \\nsubsidiary instructions. It will also formulate a framework to enhance their \\nresponsiveness and development of the financial sector.  \\nJan Vishwas Bill 2.0  \\n107. In the Jan Vishwas Act 2023, more than 180 legal provisions were \\ndecriminalized. Our Government  will now bring up the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 to \\ndecriminalize more than 100 provisions in various laws.   \\nFiscal Policy  \\n108. Now I move to fiscal policy matters.  \\nFiscal Consolidation  \\n109. In the July Budget, I had committed to staying the course for fiscal \\nconsolidation. Our endeavour will be to keep the fiscal deficit each year such \\nthat the Central Government debt remains on a declining path as a \\npercentage of the GDP. Th e roadmap for the next 6 years has been detailed in \\nthe FRBM statement.           \\nRevised Estimates 2024 -25 \\n110. The Revised  Estimate  of the total  receipts  other  than  borrowings  is  \\n` 31.47  lakh crore,  of which  the net tax receipts are ` 25.57  lakh crore. The \\nRevised Estimate of the total expenditure is ` 47.16  lakh crore,  of which the   19  \\n \\ncapital  expenditure  is about  ` 10.18  lakh crore.  \\n111. The Revised Estimate of the fiscal deficit is 4.8 per cent of GDP.  \\nBudget Estimates 2025 -26 \\n112. Coming to 2025 -26, the total receipts other than  borrowings  and the \\ntotal expenditure are estimated at ` 34.96  lakh crore and ` 50.65  lakh crore \\nrespectively. The net tax receipts are estimated at ` 28.37  lakh crore.  \\n113. The fiscal  deficit  is estimated  to be 4.4 per cent  of GDP . \\n114. To finance the fiscal deficit, the net market borrowings from dated \\nsecurities are estimated at ` 11.54 lakh crore. The balance financing is \\nexpected to come from small savings and other sources. The gross market \\nborrowings are estimated at ` 14.8 2 lakh cr ore. \\nI will now move  to Part  B. \\n \\n   20  \\n \\nPART B  \\nIndirect Taxes  \\n115. My proposals relating to Customs aim to rationalize tariff structure \\nand address duty inversion. These will also support domestic manufacturing \\nand value addition, promote exports, facilitate trade and provide relief to \\ncommon people.  \\nRationalisation of C ustoms Tariff Structure for Industrial Goods  \\n116. As a part of comprehensive review of Customs rate structure \\nannounced in July 2024 Budget, I propose to:  \\n(i) remove seven tariff rates. This is over and above the seven tariff \\nrates removed in 2023 -24 budget. After this, there will be only \\neight remaining tariff rates including ‘zero’ rate.  \\n(ii) apply appropriate cess to broadly maintain effective duty \\nincidence except on a few items, where such incidence will reduce \\nmarginally.  \\n(iii) levy not more than one cess or surcharge.  Therefore, I propose to \\nexempt Social Welfare Surcharge on 82 tariff lines that are subject \\nto a cess.  \\n117. I shall now take up sector specific proposals.  \\nRelief on import of Drugs/Medicines  \\n118.  To provide relief to patients, particularly those suffering from ca ncer, \\nrare diseases and other severe chronic diseases, I propose to add 36 lifesaving \\ndrugs and medicines to the list of medicines fully exempted from Basic \\nCustoms Duty (BCD).  I also propose to add 6 lifesaving medicines to the list \\nattracting concession al customs duty of 5%. Full exemption and concessional \\nduty will also respectively apply on the bulk drugs for manufacture of the \\nabove.  \\n119. Specified drugs and medicines under Patient Assistance Programmes \\nrun by pharmaceutical companies are fully exempt fro m BCD, provided the  21  \\n \\nmedicines are supplied free of cost to patients. I propose to add 37 more \\nmedicines along with 13 new patient assistance programmes.  \\nSupport to Domestic Manufacturing and Value addition  \\nCritical Minerals  \\n120. In the July 2024 Budget, I had fully exempted BCD on 25 critical \\nminerals that are not domestically available. I had also reduced BCD of 2 \\nother such minerals to provide a major fillip to their processing especially by \\nMSMEs. Now, I propose to fully exempt  cobalt powder and waste, the scrap \\nof lithium -ion battery, Lead, Zinc and 12 more critical minerals. This will help \\nsecure their availability for manufacturing in India and promote more jobs for \\nour youth.  \\nTextiles  \\n121.  To promote domestic production of tech nical textile products such as \\nagro -textiles, medical textiles and geo textiles at competitive prices, I propose \\nto add two more types of shuttle -less looms to the list of fully exempted \\ntextile machinery.  I also propose to revise the BCD rate on knitted fabrics \\ncovered by nine tariff lines from “10% or 20%” to “20% or ` 115 per kg, \\nwhichever is higher”.  \\nElectronic Goods  \\n122. In line with our ‘Make in India’ policy, and to rectify inverted duty \\nstructure, I propose to increase the BCD on Interactive Flat Panel Display \\n(IFPD) from 10% to 20% and reduce the BCD to 5% on Open Cell and other \\ncomponents.  \\n123. In 2023 -24 Budget, for the manufacture of Open Cells of LCD/LED TVs, \\nI had reduced the BCD on parts of Open Cells from 5% to 2.5% . To further \\nboost the manufactur e of such Open Cells, the BCD on these parts will now \\nstand exempted.  \\nLithium Ion Battery  \\n124. To the list of exempted capital goods, I propose to add 35 additional \\ncapital goods for EV battery manufacturing, and 28 additional capital goods \\nfor mobile phone bat tery manufacturing. This will boost domestic \\nmanufacture of lithium -ion battery, both for mobile phones and electric \\nvehicles.  \\nShipping Sector   22  \\n \\n125.  Considering that shipbuilding has a long gestation period, I propose to \\ncontinue the exemption of BCD on raw mat erials, components, consumables \\nor parts for the manufacture of ships for another ten years. I also propose the \\nsame dispensation for ship breaking to make it more competitive.  \\nTelecommunication  \\n126. To prevent classification disputes, I propose to reduce the BCD from \\n20% to 10% on Carrier Grade ethernet switches to make it at par with Non -\\nCarrier Grade ethernet switches.  \\nExport Promotion  \\nHandicraft Goods  \\n127.  To facilitate exports of handicrafts, I propose to extend the time \\nperiod for export from six months  to one year, further extendable by another \\nthree months, if required. I also propose to add nine items to the list of duty -\\nfree inputs.  \\nLeather sector  \\n128.   I propose to fully exempt BCD on Wet Blue leather to facilitate \\nimports for domestic value addition and employment. I also propose to \\nexempt crust leather from 20% export duty to facilitate exports by small \\ntanners.  \\nMarine products  \\n129.  To enhance India \\'s competitiveness in the global seafood market, I \\npropose to reduce BCD from 30% to 5% on  Frozen Fish Paste (Surimi) for \\nmanufacture and export of its analogue products. I also propose to reduce \\nBCD from 15% to 5% on fish hydrolysate for manufacture of fi sh and   shrimp \\nfeeds.  \\nDomestic MROs for Railway Goods  \\n130.  In July 2024 Budget, to promote development of domestic MROs for \\naircraft and ships, I had extended the time limit for export of foreign origin \\ngoods that were imported for repairs, from 6 months  to one year and further \\nextendable by one year.  I now propose to extend the same dispensation for \\nrailway goods.  \\n \\nTrade facilitation   23  \\n \\nTime limit for Provisional Assessment  \\n131.  Presently, the Customs Act, 1962 does not provide any time limit to \\nfinalize  Provisional Assessments leading to uncertainty and cost to trade. As a \\nmeasure of promoting ease of doing business, I propose to fix a time -limit of \\ntwo years, extendable by a year, for finalising the provisional assessment.  \\n Voluntary Compliance  \\n132.  I propose to introduce a new provision that will enable importers or \\nexporters, after clearance of goods, to voluntarily declare material facts and \\npay duty with interest but without penalty. This will incentivise voluntary \\ncompliance.  However, this will  not apply in cases where department has \\nalready initiated audit or investigation proceedings.  \\nExtended Time for End Use  \\n133. For industry to better plan their imports, I propose to extend the time \\nlimit for the end -use of imported inputs in the relevant r ules, from six months \\nto one year. This will provide operational flexibility in view of cost and \\nuncertainty of supply. Further, such importers will now have to file only \\nquarterly statements instead of a monthly statement.  \\n \\nDirect Taxes  \\nI now come to my Direct tax proposals.  \\n134.  In Part A, I have briefly underlined Taxation Reforms as one of key \\nreforms to realize our vision of Viksit Bharat.  In respect of criminal law, Our \\nGovernment had earlier ushered in Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita replacing \\nBharatiya Danda  Sanhita. I am happy to inform this August House and the \\ncountry that the new income -tax bill will carry forward the same spirit of \\n“Nyaya”. The new bill will be clear and direct in text with close to half of the \\npresent law, in terms of both chapters and words. It will be simple to \\nunderstand for taxpayers and tax administration, leading to tax certainty and \\nreduced litigation.   \\n135. Reforms, however, are not a destination. They are a means to achieve \\ngood governance for our people and economy. Providing good governance \\nprimarily involves being responsive. The Thirukkural captures this in Vers e \\n542, which reads:  \\nவான ாக்கி  வாழும்  உலககல்லாம்  ம ் வ ்  \\nனகால்ன ாக்கி  வாழுங் குடி.  24  \\n \\nvaanokki vaalum ulakellaam mannavan  \\nkoalnokki vaalung kuti  \\nMeaning:  \\nJust as living beings live expecting rains,  \\nCitizens live expecting good governance.  \\nOur Government  is committed to keeping an ear to the ground and a finger \\non the pulse, and responding while balancing our nation -building efforts. The \\nfollowing measures will detail just how our Government  under the guidance \\nof PM Modi has taken steps to understand and address the needs voiced by \\nour citizens. My tax proposals are guided by this spirit.  \\n136. The objectives of my proposals are as follows:  \\n(i) Personal Income Tax reforms with special focus on middle \\nclass  \\n(ii) Rationalization of TDS/TCS for easing difficulties  \\n(iii) Encoura ging voluntary compliance  \\n(iv) Reducing compliance burden  \\n(v) Ease of doing business  \\n(vi) Employment and investment  \\nI will come to my proposal on personal income tax towards the end.  \\nTDS/TCS rationalization for easing difficulties  \\n137. I propose to rationalize Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) by reducing the \\nnumber of rates and thresholds above which TDS is deducted. Further, \\nthreshold amounts for tax deduction will be increased for better clarity and \\nuniformity. The limit for tax deduction  on interest for senior citizens is being  \\ndoubled from the present ` 50,000 to ` 1 lakh. Similarly, the annual limit of ` \\n2.40 lakh for TDS on rent is being  increased to ` 6 lakh. This will reduce the \\nnumber of transactions liable to TDS, thus benefitting small tax payers \\nreceiving small payments.  \\n138. The threshold to collect tax at source (TCS) on remittances under RBI’s \\nLiberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS)  is proposed to be  increased from ` 7 \\nlakh to ` 10 lakh. I also propose to remove TCS on remittances for education \\npurposes, where such remittance is out of a loan taken from a specified \\nfinancial institution.   25  \\n \\n139. Both TDS and TCS  are being applied on any transaction relating to sale \\nof goods. To prevent s uch compliance difficulties, I propose to omit the TCS. I \\nalso propose that the provisions of the higher TDS deduction will now apply \\nonly in non -PAN cases.  \\n140.  In July 2024, the delay for payment of TDS up to the due date of filing \\nstatement was decriminaliz ed. I propose to provide the same relaxation to \\nTCS provisions as well.  \\nEncouraging Voluntary Compliance  \\n141. The Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi \\nbelieves in “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas”. In \\nline with this, we brought in updated return facility in 2022 for voluntary \\ncompliance by taxpayers who had omitted to report their correct income. \\nOur trust in taxpayers was proved right. Nearly 90 lakh taxpayers voluntarily \\nupdated their incomes by paying additional tax . Taking this trust further, I \\nnow propose to extend the time -limit to file updated returns  for any \\nassessment year , from the current limit of two years, to four years.  \\nReducing Compliance Burden  \\n142. I propose to reduce the compliance burden for small charita ble \\ntrusts/institutions by increasing their period of registration from 5 years to 10 \\nyears. It is also proposed that disproportionate consequences do not arise for \\nminor defaults, such as incomplete applications filed by charitable entities.  \\n143. Presently tax -payers can claim the annual value of self -occupied \\nproperties as nil only on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Considering the \\ndifficulties faced by taxpayers, it is proposed to allow the benefit of two such \\nself-occupied properties without any condit ion.  \\nEase of Doing Business  \\n144. To streamline the process of transfer pricing and to provide an \\nalternative to yearly examination, I propose to introduce a scheme for \\ndetermining arm\\'s length price of international transaction for a block period \\nof three yea rs. This will be in line with global best practices.  \\n145. With a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international \\ntaxation, the scope of safe harbour rules is being expanded.    \\n146. A number of senior and very senior citizens have very old National \\nSavings Scheme accounts. As interest is no longer payable on such accounts, I  26  \\n \\npropose to exempt withdrawals made from NSS by individuals on or after the \\n29th of August, 2024. I am also proposing to allow similar treatment to NPS \\nVatsalya accounts as is ava ilable to normal NPS accounts, subject to overall \\nlimits.  \\n147. In my speech in July 2024, I had promised that all processes including \\ngiving effect to appellate orders shall be digitalized and made paper -less over \\nthe next two years. I am happy to announce that  digitalization is being made \\noperational.  \\n148. In July 2024, we brought in the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme to resolve \\nincome tax disputes pending in appeal. The scheme has received a great \\nresponse, with nearly 33,000 tax payers having availed of this scheme to \\nsettle their disputes.  \\nEmployment and Investment  \\n149. I have a few proposals to promote investment and employment.  \\nTax certainty for electronics manufacturing Schemes  \\n150. It is proposed to provide a presumptive taxation regime for non -\\nresidents who provide services to a resident company that is establishing or \\noperating an electronics manufacturing facility. I further propose to introduce \\na safe harbour for tax certainty fo r non -residents who store components for \\nsupply to specified electronics manufacturing units.  \\nTonnage Tax Scheme for Inland Vessels  \\n151. Presently the tonnage tax scheme is available to only sea going ships. \\nThe benefits of existing tonnage tax scheme are propo sed to be extended to \\ninland vessels registered under the Indian Vessels Act, 2021 to promote \\ninland water transport in the country.  \\nExtension for incorporation of Start -Ups \\n152. We continue to support the Indian start -up eco -system. I propose to \\nextend the per iod of incorporation by 5 years to allow the benefit available to \\nstart -ups which are incorporated before 1.4.2030.  \\nInternational Financial Services Centre (IFSC)   27  \\n \\n153. In order to attract and promote additional activities in the IFSC, I am \\ninter alia  proposing specific benefits to ship -leasing units, insurance offices \\nand treasury centres of global companies which are set up in IFSC.  Further, \\nto claim benefits, the cut -off date for commencement in IFSC has also been \\nextended by five years to 31.3.203 0. \\nAlternate Investment Funds (AIFs)  \\n154. Category I and category II AIFs are undertaking investments in \\ninfrastructure and other such sectors. I propose to provide certainty of \\ntaxation to these entities on the gains from securities.  \\nExtension of investment da te for Sovereign and Pension Funds  \\n155. To promote funding from Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds \\nto the infrastructure sector, I propose to extend the date of making an \\ninvestment by five more years, to 31st March, 2030.  \\nPersonal Income - tax Reforms wi th special focus on middle class  \\n156. Democracy, Demography and Demand are the key support pillars in \\nour journey towards Viksit Bharat. The middle class provides strength for \\nIndia’s growth. This Government  under the leadership of Prime Minister \\nModi has alway s believed in the admirable energy and ability of the middle \\nclass in nation building. In recognition of their contribution, we have \\nperiodically reduced their tax burden. Right after 2014, the ‘Nil tax’ slab was \\nraised to  \\n` 2.5 lakh, which was further ra ised to ` 5 lakh in 2019 and to ` 7 lakh in 2023. \\nThis is reflective of our Government ’s trust on the middle -class tax payers. I \\nam now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable up to \\nincome of ` 12 lakh (i.e. average income of ` 1 lakh per month other than \\nspecial rate income  such as capital gains ) under the new regime. This limit \\nwill be ` 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of ` \\n75,000.  \\n157. Slabs and rates are being changed across the board to benefit all  tax-\\npayers. The new structure will substantially reduce the taxes of the middle \\nclass and leave more money in their hands, boosting household \\nconsumption, savings and investment.  \\n158.  In the new tax regime, I propose to revise tax rate structure as \\nfollows:  \\n0-4 lakh rupees  Nil  28  \\n \\n4-8 lakh rupees  5 per cent  \\n8-12 lakh rupees  10 per cent  \\n12-16 lakh rupees  15 per cent  \\n16-20 lakh rupees  20 per cent  \\n20- 24 lakh rupees  25 per cent  \\nAbove 24 lakh rupees  30 per cent  \\n159. To tax payers upto ` 12 lakh of normal income (other than special rate \\nincome  such as capital gains ) tax rebate is being provided in addition to the \\nbenefit due to slab rate reduction in such a manner that there is no tax \\npayable by them. The total tax benefit of slab rate ch anges and rebate at \\ndifferent income levels can be illustrated with examples. A tax payer in the \\nnew regime with an income of ` 12 lakh will get a benefit of ` 80,000 in tax \\n(which is 100% of tax payable as per existing  rates). A person having income \\nof ` 18 lakh will get a benefit of ` 70,000 in tax (30% of tax payable as per \\nexisting  rates).  \\nA person with an income of ` 25 lakh gets a benefit of ` 1,10,000 (25% of his \\ntax payable as per existing  rates).  \\n160. Details of my tax proposals are given in the Annex ure. \\n161. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ₹ 1 lakh crore in \\ndirect taxes and ₹ 2600 crore in indirect taxes will be forgone.  \\nMr. Speaker Sir, with this, I commend the budget to this august House.  \\nJai Hind.  \\n   29  \\n \\nAnnexures to Part A  \\nAnnexure A  \\nBuilding Rural Prosperity and Resilience  \\nThe programme will focus at:  \\n1) catalyzing enterprise development, employment and financial independence \\nfor rural women;  \\n2) accelerating creation of new employment and businesses for young farmers \\nand rural youth;  \\n3) nurt uring and modernizing agriculture for productivity improvement and \\nwarehousing, especially for marginal and small farmers; and  \\n4) diversifying opportunities for landless families.  \\n \\nAnnexure B  \\nMission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses  \\nThe Mission will place emphasis on:  \\n1) development and commercial availability of climate resilient seeds,  \\n2) enhancing protein content,  \\n3) increasing productivity,  \\n4) improving post -harvest storage and management, and  \\n5) assuring remunerative prices to the farmers.    \\n \\n  30  \\n \\nAnnexure C  \\nIndia Po st as a Catalyst for the Rural Economy  \\nThe expanded range of services will include:  \\n1) rural community hub colocation;  \\n2) institutional account services;  \\n3) DBT, cash out and EMI pick -up; \\n4) credit services to micro enterprises;  \\n5) insurance; and  \\n6) assisted digital services.  \\n \\nAnnexure D  \\n \\n \\nAnnexure E  \\nManufacturing Mission - Furthering “Make in India  \\nThe Mission’s mandate will include 5 focus areas:  \\n1) ease and cost of doing business;  \\n2) future ready workforce for in -demand jobs;  \\n3) a vibrant and dynamic  MSM E sector;  \\n4) availability of technology; and  \\n5) quality products.  \\n 31  \\n \\nAnnexure to Part B  \\nAmendments relating to Indirect Taxes  \\nA.
